# stm32f4disco-rs-lab

Personal lab monorepo containing Rust applications and crates for the STMicroelectronics
[STM32F4DISCOVERY](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32f4discovery.html) development board,
featuring the 72 MHz [STM32F405xx/STM32F407xx](https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/stm32f407vg.pdf)
family of Arm(R) Cortex(R)-M4 MCUs with FPU.

## MCU Description

The STM32F405xx and STM32F407xx family is based on the high-performance Arm(R)
Cortex(R)-M4 32-bit RISC core operating at a frequency of up to 168 MHz. The Cortex(R)-M4
core features a single-precision floating point unit (FPU) which supports all Arm single-
precision data-processing instructions and data types. It also implements a full set of DSP
instructions and a memory protection unit (MPU) which enhances application security.

The STM32F405xx and STM32F407xx family incorporates high-speed embedded
memories (flash memory up to 1 Mbyte, up to 192 Kbytes of SRAM), up to 4 Kbytes of
backup SRAM, and an extensive range of enhanced I/Os and peripherals connected to two
APB buses, three AHB buses and a 32-bit multi-AHB bus matrix.

All devices offer three 12-bit ADCs, two DACs, a low-power RTC, twelve general-purpose
16-bit timers including two PWM timers for motor control, two general-purpose 32-bit timers.
a true random number generator (RNG). They also feature standard and advanced
communication interfaces.
